/**
 * Implement of {@link ConnectionFactory} using RocketMQ client.
 *
 * <P>In RocketMQ, all producers and consumers interactive with broker
 * by an {@link MQClientInstance} object, which encapsulates tcp connection,
 * schedule task and so on. The best way to control the behavior of producers/consumers
 * derived from a connection is to manipulate the {@link MQClientInstance} directly.
 *
 * <P>However, this object is not easy to access as it is maintained within RocketMQ Client.
 * Fortunately another equivalent identifier called "instanceName" is provided.
 * The "instanceName" is a one-to-one conception with {@link MQClientInstance} object.
 * Just like there is a hash map,"instanceName" is the key and a {@link MQClientInstance}
 * object is the value. So the essential keyword passed through all objects created by a
 * connection is "instanceName".
